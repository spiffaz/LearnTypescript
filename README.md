# LearnTypescript

My notes

Typescript is built on top Javascript. Every Typescript application is a Javascript application.
Basically Javascript with type checking.

It is statically typed. 

Disadvantages
Must be compiled


## Setup Development environment
Install node.js (https://nodejs.org/en)

npm - node package manager
